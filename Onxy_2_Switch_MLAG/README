2-Switch MLAG Configurations
============================================
The flatfiles in this repository will set up the MLAG configuration between two switches [leafs] and two servers connected to that switches. 

Topology
--------
2 switches connected  with each other (MLAG), and two hosts connected to both switches


Playbook Package
================

Pre-resiquite
-------------

1. Make sure Ansible is configured. 
2. Make sure switches have latest OS, are with default configuration and with license installed.
3. Server must be running Ubuntu, Centos or Rhel
4. Physical connection should be exactly same as shown in topology file.


Running this playbook will configure the system based on the topology attached in this package. The directory will contain following files and sub-directory:

1. site.yml             # Change interface speed if needed 
2. hosts                # Inside the file, Change Management IP address of the switches and servers (in this example,
                        # switches are named as leaf1 and leaf2.
                        # Inside the file, Change the name of your switches or servers to exactly matching this file,
                        # or change this file as per your switch name. If you change this file, then change the folder
                        # names under inventory folder too.
                        # Inside the file, Change the password of switches and the servers.
3. roles/               # Sub folder carring configurations.
4. roles/<switch>/tasks/main.yml  # The task file to configure switch, change speed if needed.
5. roles/servers/inventory/<server>/<interface_file>  # Ethernet file configuration.
8. roles/servers/tasks/main.yml          # No change required.
10. roles/<switch>/tasks/main.yml        # The task file to configure the mlag over the each switch.
                                         # No Change needed

Running Configuration Package
=============================

Pre-resiquite
-------------

1. Make sure switches are with default configuration and with license installed.
2. Server must be running Ubuntu Centos or Rhel. Other servers can be used, but the config files here are for Centos and Rhel.
3. Physical connection should be exactly same as shown in topology file.

Following files for uploading and running on the switch

1. <swicth_name>.cfg  # <swicth_name = leaf1; leaf2;>
